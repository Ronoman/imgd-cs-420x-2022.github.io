# Explanation
To achieve the rotating grid, I rotate()d the current pixel position around the origin depending on the current time. Then, these pixel positions were repeated by using a variable sized modulus, again depending on sin and cos waves of time. Within each of these cells, I created a few sin waves and had them move around and rotate with sin() and rotate(). Some coloring is added here that depends on the pixel position and a thickness parameter, and a small amount of noise is added to this later. Then, some feedback is added based on the backbuffer, which feeds into the red and blue channels of the final image. The red and blue channels, which are influenced by feedback, are combined with the color added in the loop for the final pixel color.

In general, I was aiming for a kaleidoscope pattern. Overall, I think the shader hits the mark. It has a variety of colors that change and shift over time, which are split up into rotating segments. However, shaders can be much more complex than kaleidoscopes. Instead of rotating static objects, I added in sinusoidal waves that fluctuate over time. This in combination with the rotation and segmentation creates a nice effect. In the future I would work on reducing the frequency and magnitude of bright flashes, as they somewhat take away from the animation.

# Feedback
I showed my work to Filip Kernan. He enjoyed the transitions between the hard lines and the sine waves. He also liked the saturation of the core lines, saying that it “gives it a futuristic vibe.” I appreciate this feedback, I enjoyed those parts of the animation as well. Filip didn’t give any negative or constructive feedback, so I think my animation was alright.
